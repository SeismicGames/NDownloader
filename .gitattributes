# be able to execute. Windows batch files require a CR/LF for labels to work
# properly, otherwise they may fail when labels straddle 512-byte block boundaries.
# This is important when files are downloaded through a zip archive that was
# authored on a Linux machine (the default behavior on GitHub)
